# ppc-fandriver
This is a fan driver I designed to sit on top of the default fan driver for Power PC Ubuntu. It may also be the default for other Distros.

To install this program and test it, download the source, extract it, and run the install script as root. You must be on the Power PC Architechture to run the precompiled binary. If you have a 64 bit power PC you would have to compile it yourself.

## WARNING: This fan driver may be agressive at times LOL
config files are at /etc/g4-fandriver
